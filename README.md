# ASTER GED Scripts  
This repository contains R and Python scripts for processing Version 3 and 4.1 Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and  
Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Emissivity Dataset (GED) data products. An R script and a Python script are  
available for each Version. Each script converts individual science datasets contained within the ASTER GED Hierarchical  
Data Format Version 5 (HDF5, *.h5) files to georeferenced GeoTIFFs with the Geographic (latitude/longitude) WGS84  
coordinate reference system.
